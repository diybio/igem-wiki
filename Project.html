    <h2>The project</h2>
    <p>
        Our goal is to develop bacteria which produce a particular scent and create a system for controlling it. Our device can be used in scent marketing and creating a unique atmosphere. We will put the bacteria in a container appropriate for the scent. For example, the scent of the forest could be produced in a container shaped like a nest box.

        Currently we are working both inside and outside of the lab. Our research plan is complete and our research has started. We will further document our project as our research goes on. You can follow our work in realtime trough Twitter and our blog.
