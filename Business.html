  <h2>Summer of Startups</h2>
  <h3>SoS in Short</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8 text-col-left">
      <p>
        We participated in Summer of Startups, a startup incubator programme by Aalto Entrepreneurship Society. We met many other startups and business-minded people. We found out how to pitch synthetic biology to people who know nothing about it. It just needed a sympathetic mascot and explanation on how a bioreactor is a workplace for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The programme included two different events for pitching our startup idea. The first was The Helsinki Challenge Pitch Night, where we pitched our idea together with other teams. Later, the Summer of Startups programme ended with a massive event, The Demo Day. We pitched our idea in front of hundreds of people and ran a booth for the whole evening, getting people excited about us and synthetic biology.
      </p>

      <h3>Being a Synthetic Biology Startup</h3>
      <p>
        There is no specific definition for a startup, but as Eric Ries puts it: "A startup is a human institution designed to deliver a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty".
      </p>
      <p>
        So, that's kind of where we were: the first-ever Finnish iGEM team with a vague idea of what to do, but no idea of how to get there.
      </p>

      <h3>The Startup Scene</h3>
      <p>
        From the early 2010's, there has been a big startup bubble in Finland. Interest in startups is on rise and investors are swarming around the Finnish startup scene. The center of startups in Finland is focused around Espoo, the town where we have our lab. The Startup Sauna is the place for startups in Espoo, situated roughly 700 meters from our lab! So why not get involved?
      </p>
      <p>
        When we decided to take part in the Summer of Startups programme, we had no idea what we signed up for. We thought there would be attending to lectures and reporting back on how we're doing with our project. We were like children on the stock market: naïve, yet full of hope. Being brave is essential part of a good startup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Summer of startups lasted for a good 9 weeks. During that time we had a lot of talks with investors, serial entrepreneurs and coaches. We attended numerous workshops, BBQs and other networking events.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4 img-100">
      <img src="http://2014.igem.org/wiki/images/5/51/Aalto_Helsinki_Rollup.png" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Networking</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8 text-col-left">
      <p>
       The startup scene is about believing in what you do and being talkative. Well, maybe not really, but it is a way to get to know the right people who can help you get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        So how do you get 9 young scientists to talk with investors and coaches, who are mainly concerned about finding the next big thing, and know nothing about biology, labwork or iGEM?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning of the programme, we took things very seriously. By listening to all the coaches and their ideas, we found out that we were of the odd ones around the Startup Sauna. None of the coaches really knew anything about biotechology or biology. Software is the big thing in startups. And for a plausible reason: setting up a software startup requires next to zero money compared to biotechnology.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Starting a biotechnology startup requires tremendous amounts of money" The point of incubator programmes is about getting investors interested in your idea and your team. There are many kinds of investors, but the ones very lucrative for startups are the angel investors. These are the people who will spot the next big thing early and fund them in exchange for a certain amount of their to-be shares in their upcoming company. They take huge risks compared to regular investors. With their help, a promising team can keep focusing on their project instead of desperately trying to find funding. It's propable that only one in ten companies pays itself back, but the profit of the for the investment is over ten-fold. That is what angel investing is all about. After initial investments, a startup can seek for venture capital and do so-called funding rounds. At first, we were really scared about getting money involved, but you shouldn't be. Most of the angel ivestors want you to continue as you are, and will become a dedicated coach for the team.

  <h3>Getting Coached</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8 text-col-left">
      <p>
        The Summer of Startups programme coupled us up with some great coaches. It was really interesting to talk with these people who have founded big companies and have actual experience on being an entrepreneur. However, it seems most of the coaches have moved from the technical industry to the marketing, since most of their focus was laid on how we look and are understood. The coaches stated that "invention first, market then" is the old way of doing things. It seemed like our idea and team were enough to start with, and this really holds true for most kinds of companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experimenting with different ideas in a quick succesion is really effective. Our problem was that our research could not be done that fast. In the end we were actually one of those "old style" startups who do their research first and then think of a market for their product. Still, we learned a very important lesson: being able to convey what is being done is crucial for a startup.
      </p>
      <blockquote>I don't understand. Are you making an application for smartphones?</blockquote>
      <p>
        Many of our discussions with the coaches started like this: "So what are you guys working on?" "We are developing a genetic switch that can be controlled with light. We want to be able to control gene expression in bacteria" "What? Bacteria?! That sounds horrible!" We started saying "organisms" instead of "bacteria", but the response that followed was something very close to: "So what are you actually doing?" We tried to express ourselves in a different way: "We are developing small bio-factories inside organisms. We can produce things like medicine!"
      </p>
      <p>
        But even after weeks of refining our explanation, the coaches' responses were still something along the lines: "I don't understand. Are you making an application for smartphones?"
      </p>
      <p>
        One has to express himself very clearly with commonly used words in order for the non-experts to understand. Why is it so important for a startup to get everyone to understand what you are doing?
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>People will tell their friends who actually understand what your startup is doing. "You know, I saw this startup which was engineering bacteria to be controlled with light, you work in the biobusiness, right?"</li>
          <li>Investors will get excited even though they have no idea what you are doing.</li>
          <li>People seem to have very limited amount time to spend listening to you talk, so getting to the point as fast as possible is crucial.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        One of the greatest methods of quickly explaining what you do is pitching.
      </p>

  <h3 id="pitch-title">Pitching</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8 text-col-left">
      <p>
        Pitching is about expressing and presenting your idea, enthusiasm, team and expretise to an audience. A great example of this is the elevator pitch: a short, structured explanation about your idea and its potential in 30 seconds to 2 minutes. The idea is, that if you happen to stumble upon someone who could be beneficial to your project on an elevator, you should be able to get their full attention and deliver your idea before the ride is over!
      </p>
      <p>
        We Pitched A LOT and the coaches were constantly ranting at us: "NO, BAD, DO IT AGAIN!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Our pitch was revolutionized by <b>Brian, The Bacterium</b>. We wanted to keep the word bacterium in our pitch, but the big audiences seemed to be associate the word "bacteria" with disease and sickness. So, what to do? The answer is to come up with a cute bacterium that cannot be feared: Brian was born.
      </p>
      <blockquote>Once you are able to explain your startup in under two minutes, you actually have a much clearer picture about your project yourself, too!</blockquote>
      <p>
        But how did we get people to understand our idea? We told them a story about Brian, who is an ordinary guy, until we come around. We turn Brian into a superhero! The great thing about pitching is that once you are able to explain your startup in under 2 minutes, you actually have a much clearer picture about your project yourself. With thorough practice and countless hours of refining our script and slides, we were finally ready for the big thing.

  <h3>Demo Day</h3>
  <p>
    6.8.2014 (8/6/2014 for Americans). We held our biggest public set. The Demo Day is am expo-like event at Startup Sauna with over a thousand visitors during 7 hours. The event starts with expert talks and continues by having all of the teams from the Summer of Startups pitch for the whole audience. We pitched ourselves and our idea for over 600 people!
  </p>
  <p>
    Before the Demo Day, we released a video showing Mikko sneezing on an agar-plate. During the expo we also held a booth, where the results of the sneezing were on display with the original video playing on the background. At the booth, we explained more about our idea to those interested. The audience liked our display of bacterial cultures from different everyday objects. The smartphone screen was a hit! We also demonstrated our idea with our online simulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overall response was very positive. Everyone loved Brian! We nailed our pitch and people seemed to be really interested in "the guys with the lab coats". We were really different from the other startups. After almost 12 hours of continuous working we were exhausted, but really happy. We have demonstrated synthetic biology and our idea to over a thousand people!
  </p>


  <h3>Everything Led to What?</h3>
  <p>
    The Demo Day was the one big chance to get actual funding from investors. But we had realized our mottos were very different. We were, and still are very entrepeneurial, and many of our team members want to be part of a startup in the future. Our approach was to continue on public funding until we had some sort of prototype or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to demonstrate our idea with. This was partially because of the companies we met: they were actually in the biotechnology business and told us to come back with a prototype.
  </p>

  <h3>Prototype & Patents</h3>
  <p>
    So how do you demonstrate that your idea really works? With a Minimum Viable Product: something that is the core of your work and demonstrates that your assumptions are not far off.
  </p>
  <p>
    So how do we demonstrate Brian? We have limited knowledge of bioreactors or any applicable processes. Therefore we decided to focus on research results. They would hopefully reveal the true potential of our idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    Simultaneously we were adviced to keep low profile on our actual inventions. Patents are monsters which every startup will eventually run into. We got advice from visiting lawyers to keep shut and file patents. And for a while this was our thought. In the end we decided to publish our research for a couple of reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Our results were not enough to get the system fully working. Even though we publish our results, the additional steps required to build a working system could be, in theory, patented.</li>
    <li>We were running out of time. Competing in iGEM was our main goal. Having filed a patent for our invention would have been a great learning experience, but it would have been very stressful and would have made us focus on the wrong things. Then we came up with an alternative: Open Source Biology.</li>
    <li>Suddenly we found a new and inspiring way of thinking synthetic biology startups. We researched companies like RedHat, Linux and Arduino and learned that it is possible to run a profitable business with Open Source, if you do it correctly. After a lot of researching and playing with the idea, we based our business plan on the Open Source concept.</li>

  <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
  <p>
    Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks applies the novel techniques of Synthetic Biology to create new solutions for modern industries utilizing bioprocesses of various kinds. We have demonstrated our expertise by developing a genetic switch in E. Coli that can be controlled with blue light, with which the user can change between three different genes of his/her own choice. Having the right genes active at the right time provides major shortcuts in reaction pathways inside bioreactors, leading to faster production, less waste, lower maintenance costs and a wide range of scientific application in both research and development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks business plan and idea are based on technologies and solutions under Open Source license. We aim to offer chargeable tailoring, consultation and development services based on the free information that everyone has access to, but only our team of experts knows how to master. Developing a close, mutually beneficial relationship with all our customers is the basis of our successful business.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the field of computer software, numerous companies, such as Red Hat and Arduino have been successful in their business having based their strategy on open source thinking. In short, this means that the source code of the program itself is freely available for everyone to use and improve. The improvements done by the users must be made available for the entire community. The revenue based around Open Source technology is created by offering consultation and implementation services.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have concluded that the same business opportunities can be found in modern technology and science, especially in synthetic biology. Further business opportunities can be found in selling hardware and helping at customizing the systems to meet the clients’ specific needs. Our strategy involves long-term, well-maintained customer relationships, supportive and interactive community, and building on our customer base using feedback and referrals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Synthetic biology is a fast growing field in modern scientific research. Combined with the accelerated growth of the energy market, there is a new market opportunity in biofuels. Biofuels alone have a global market of 70 billion euros and the market is estimated to have an annual growth rate of 8% to 18% by 2020. In addition to biofuels, synthetic biology has potential markets in high value biological compounds (such as pharmaceuticals) and other industrial bioprocesses involving capacious bioreactors.
  </p>
  <p>
    These industries and their research and development sections utilize different organisms, like bacteria and algae, to reach the end product. However, bacteria perform only a single function in the process and the control over them is extremely limited, as discussed in the introduction of our Research-section. Because of the continuous need for maintenance and the need to have different organisms designed for each stage of production,  bioprocesses of industrial scale are expensive to both design and maintain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks’ executive team consists of talented university students with numerous fields of expertise, ranging from synthetic biology to mathematics and computer science. Our team has a strong background in both research and product development, and we aim to combine the theoretical viewpoints with engineering to create the best possible solutions for companies utilizing modern bioreactor technology. In addition, we have assembled a board of advisors to provide scientific and management expertise. This includes professors and researchers from Aalto University, University of Helsinki, VTT and Aalto Entrepreneurship Society.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks can be sustained with public money and the support of universities. At current stage, our research does not require considerable capital investments to proceed, since we have the rights to use Aalto University’s research laboratories. We are looking for funding to cover expenses from finishing the research and development of our first technology and for its commercialization. In additon, we need funding for renting workspace and direct material costs. We are looking for connections with research teams in synthetic biology, bioprocessing technology and medicine production. We are also looking for companies and research groups to pilot our genetic switch. The pilot customers can be from any field utilizing bioreactors in their production, for example medical industry and biofuel industry, or any companies or research groups who could have use for our genetic switch.
  </p>

  <h3>Vision, Values and Mission Statement</h3>
  <p>
    Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks is the first iGEM team from Finland. It is also one of the two undergraduate teams participating in the Entrepreneurship track in the iGEM 2014 competition. In summer 2014, we graduated from Aalto Entrepreneurship Society’s Summer of Startups incubator programme. Our team consists of nine talented students from Aalto University and University of Helsinki.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using our interdisciplinary expertise, we aim to build a company that provides new solutions and technologies using synthetic biology. This covers a vast variety of different approaches, from very special tailored solutions to generic, universal and integratable platforms. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The key values of our work are the benefits of licensing our technologies and research under an Open Source licence. We believe in BioBrick Foundation’s approach of standardizing biological parts and keeping all research open, transparent and free to use by other researchers. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks’ vision of Open Source Biology is defined as follows
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The technologies and solutions using synthetic biology must be freely distributable.</li>
    <li>The information required in order to use these technologies must be available for free.</li>
    <li>The distribution of derived products must be allowed.</li>
    <li>Individuals or groups must all have equal rights.</li>
    <li>Usage or purposes of technology or solution must not be limited.</li>
    <li>Every user has the same rights.</li>
    <li>License must not depend on a wider solution environment. The rights to the technology must remain the same even if it is taken away from its context of distribution.</li>
    <li>The license may not limit other technologies or solutions. The technology or solution must also be distributable with technologies or solutions not licensed under Open Source Biology license.</li>
    <li>The contents of the licence must not depend on technical realisation. The rights must not contain any conditions concerning the distribution or usage of the information needed in order to use the technology or solution.</li>
    <li>The derivatives of technologies or solutions may not expand the rights defined in this license. More limiting licenses are allowed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Following this philosophy means that our solutions and technologies are free to use by the scientific community and industrial operatives. This way the whole world may profit from new scientific discoveries and at the same time, new improvements and modifications to our technologies by other parties are also at our disposal. Making our work Open Source, we can help creating a world wide community of improving, updating and sharing existing biological technologies, while at the same time building profitable business around them. In other words, we want to bring Open Source thinking to the business side of synthetic biology community in order to boost the fast development of this relatively young branch of science.
