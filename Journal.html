    <h2>There and Back Again<br>
    <small>an iGEM team's tale by Aalto-Helsinki</small></h2>
    <p>
        We worked hard but it all paid off. We had fun, we made new friends. We did something new, we learned something new. It was an amazing journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tähän vois kirjotella jotain hauskaa lisää vielä.

    <h2>Safety</h2>
    <h3>General Safety Matters</h3>
    <p>
        All members of our team, who work in the lab, have had a safety training as a part of their studies. The training covered the following topics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal protective wear: safety goggles, lab coats and gloves
      </li>
      <li>General safety: acting in case of an accident, where to find emergency showers and fire extinguishers, understanding safety labels
      </li>
      <li>Chemical safety: working with different chemicals and how to dispose of them
      </li>
      <li>GMO safety: putting all waste that has been in contact with bacteria (living or dead) to bacterial waste, aseptic working methods
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In our iGEM work we have only worked with non-toxic <i>E. coli</i> (K12 derivatives) and all the protein coding sequences that we have used in our project are non-hazardous. We did not create new protein coding sequences but instead we used sequences that are already available as Biobricks.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Laboratory</h3>
    <p>
      We got to work in the Bioprocess Technology lab of Aalto University. We had our own table and we got to use all the instruments in the department. We also did some measurements in the labs of VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.

    <h3>Our Office</h3>
    <p>
      We also needed a proper office space where we could work during the summer since not everyone was going to do lab work all the time (and there wasn't that much space in the lab either).
    </p>
    <p>
      We managed to find the "Learning Hub Living Room (CHEM)" (Vuori Hub) in the building of Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Since it was summer, there weren't many people around to use the space and we made it our home. It was a very comfortable place to work in!

    <h2>Timeline</h2>

    <p>Being the first team in Finland, we wanted to make sure that we documented everything we did as closely as possible. Below you can find a nice pictured timeline with the biggest events and other fun things we did during the project.</p>

    <p>We borrowed a convention from the software development framework, Scrum. Every day, all the team members answered three question: "What did you do yesterday?", "What will you do today?" and "What is stopping you from doing that?". We wrote the answers down in our online team tool and made a detailed description of every single working day during the summer. So if you really really want to read exactly what we did, here's 30 pages of text for you to check out:
