	Hienoimmista jutuista isot kuvat / jotain hauskoja lauseita tänne. Mainostusta kaikkein makeimmille jutuille, mitä ollaan tehty. Tarkemmat kuvaukset sitten erikseen omille sivuilleen. Vois ehkä jaotella tapahtumat keskenään, some yhteen jne, ettei jää liian vähää tekstiä minnekään...

<h2> Summer of Startups</h2>
<p>
	We took part in Summer of Startups, a startup incubator by Aalto University. We met a lot of other small startups and people interested in them. We found out how to pitch synthetic biology to people that know nothing about it. It just needed a sympathetic mascot and explaining how a bioreactor is a work place for him. 
</p>
<p>
	The program included two different occasions where we pitched our startup idea. There was pitching night, where we competed in pitching with all the other teams. Then there was Demo Day, a massive event with hundreds of people where we presented ourselves and run a booth for the whole evening, getting people excited about us and synthetic biolocgy.

<h2> How to become a Synthetic Biology Startup </h2>
<h3> Starting </h3>

<p> [Great advice for what to do at the very start] </p>

<h3> Challenges </h3>

<p> [What are the most difficult things. Making investors understand, making a product, selling it, law] </p>

<h3> Solutions </h3>

<p> [How to solve all the problems we encountered. Don't choose a product that requires you to move geneticalli modified bacteria outside of the lab.]

<h3> The difficulty of explaining what you do </h3>

<p> [The big one, but we solved it with Brian] </p>

[Meet Brian, maybe as a video?]

<h2> Building a Synthetic Biology Community in Finland </h2>

<p> Active blogging, tweeting, Facebook-interaction, everything. <p>

<p> Plans for recruiting a new iGEM team and paving the way for them in terms of supporters etc.</p>

<h3> The Seeker tools </h3>

<p> One of our main contributions to the iGEM Community. A tool for searching through the 2014 iGEM distribution more easily than checking through a massive Excel sheet. BioBrick Seeker is even featured on the iGEM 2014 Distribution Help page. </p>

<p> We have tracked the users of the program through Google Analytics and we have users from dozens of countries and almost all continents. </p>

[Sweet data and pictures]

<p> We also have been featured on a bunch of other team's wikis, hopefully. </p>
