	<h2>Starting Up</h2>
	<div class="col-md-8 text-col-left">
		<p>
			We took part in Summer of Startups, a startup incubator by Aalto University. We met a lot of other small startups and people interested in them. We found out how to pitch synthetic biology to people that know nothing about it. It just needed a sympathetic mascot and explaining how a bioreactor is a work place for him. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The program included two different occasions where we pitched our startup idea. There was pitching night, where we competed in pitching with all the other teams. Then there was Demo Day, a massive event with hundreds of people where we presented ourselves and run a booth for the whole evening, getting people excited about us and synthetic biology. We presented ourselves to an audience of hundreds and many of them came by our booth later.

			<h3>A Website for the General Public</h3>
			<p>
				At the very beginning of the project we wanted to create a website that we could link to our friends, new acquaintances and potential sponsors. It included basic info about us and general overview of the project. We started developing it rapidly and it actually got into a presentable shape fairly fast. We expected to attract sponsors with the page, but the most important function turned about to be for media to use as a basis for a story and for our Facebook fans to get a more in-depth introduction to us. 
			</p>

			<img src="http://2014.igem.org/wiki/images/0/0f/Aalto_Helsinki_Webdraft.png" class="img-responsive">
			<p class="kuvateksti">
				This is how the first plan of the "sponsor website" looked like. We developed it further during the project. It might be still available at <a href="http://www.aaltohelsinki.com/">http://www.aaltohelsinki.com/</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3> The Wiki </h3>
			<p>
				The first web page was great practice for making the wiki. We already started wiki-work in June by making an upload tool and a basic page outline. We revised the look again in August and started writing final content. We wanted to make sure it wasn't completely done in the last week before the wiki freeze.
			</p>
			<p>
				We did everything on the wiki from scratch, there's no templates. Just HTML, CSS and JavaScript written by us. Bootstrap and JQuery were the only libraries used, to help make the layout of the page.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Both the websites are available on GitHub.
			</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		We also made <a href="http://github.com/iGEM-QSF/igem-wiki">iGEM Wiki Quickifier.</a>, a tool to upload content to a particular team wiki without using the cumbersome wiki interface. It allows you to write all the pages as proper HTML and add template tags while uploading, so that they don't come in the way of writing actual content. It's work in progress and changing it to upload to other wikis than ours is not implemented, but if you know a bit of Python, it's easily done.</p>

	<p>
		All of the code and installation instructions are available at the project's <a href="http://github.com/iGEM-QSF/igem-wiki">GitHub page.</a>

			<h3>Flappy Coli</h3>
			<p>
				We also made a silly game called <a href="http://aaltohelsinki.com/flappycoli">Flappy Coli</a>, where you are guiding a genetically modified pink bacteria through an iGEM-maze. It grows it's flagellum when you get farther and if you are good enough, it might grow more flagella!
