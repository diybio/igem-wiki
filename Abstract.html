<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
	We are the first-ever Finnish iGEM Team and one of the three teams in the new entrepreneurship track. Our aim is to build active synthetic biology community in Finland, to learn and share what biotech entrepreneurship takes and to find an open way to build business on synthetic biology.
<br /><br />
We are engineering bacteria whose gene expression can be controlled with blue light. In contrast to previous research, our remote controller is based on light intensity instead of different wavelengths. Thus, we have created a multi-channel switch that requires only one wavelength.
<br /><br />
Our device could be used in bioreactors, making prototyping and multi-phase production chains faster, easier and more profitable. Weâ€™re making a proof-of-concept controller prototype for research teams, but it can be further scaled up for industrial purposes, such as medical and biofuel industry.
