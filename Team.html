    <h2>The Team</h2>

    <p>
        We are a skillful and persistent group of nine Finns. We started as a group of students who didn't really know each other, assuming that we are going to spend our summer studying synthetic biology with strange collegues. We ended up getting a bunch of new friends and (in addition to studying synthetic biology) we just might have spent one of the best summers of our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our group is interdisciplinary and comes from University of Helsinki and Aalto University; the two big universities located in the capital of Finland, Helsinki. We have expertise in many different fields ranging from genetics to product development and from computer science to food technology.

            <h6>Official stuff</h6>
            <p>
                A fourth-year Chemical Engineering student majoring in bio and food technology.
            </p> 
            <p>    
                I am the second half of our lab team and I have been in charge of the wet lab with Martina. I have spent most of my days in the lab working with Biobricks and our dear bacteria.
                I am also the Travel Manager of our team so I have been in charge of all the things related to Boston.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the beginning of the summer I knew barely anything about gene technology, let alone synthetic biology, so it has been amazing to learn a whole bunch of new things and actually getting to do stuff in the lab on our own.
            </p>
            <p>
                One hightlight of my summer was when we got our first sequencing results and we finally had concrete proof that we had actually managed to ligate pieces of DNA together. Before that we just had to have faith in ourselves and hope things were going the right way. Now I know why some people say that science is like a religion!
            </p>
            <h6>Cool stuff</h6>
            </p>
                Music, puppies, travelling, a good cup of tea and sleeping in on a Sunday morning are my favourite things in the world.

            <p>
                My main responsibility was programming various software tools to help research and lab work, as well as developing our website and wiki. I also racked up a surprising amount of lab hours considering I had last worked in the lab 3 years ago. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also did a bunch of bioinformatics. I found myself playing around with Geneious a lot, making primers, analysing sequencing results and building things virtually before we assemble them in the lab. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The coolest thing during the summer was making BioBrick Seeker and seeing what can be achieved by a group of students in a field that we barely knew anything about.

They gave us space in the lab to work in, they supported us us financially, they ordered us reagents when we needed. Synthesizing our gene switch wasn't a problem either. It feels like we couldn't have done this, or at least this would have been a severely harder project, without Aalto.
