    <h2>The Team</h2>

    <p>
        We are a skillful and persistent group of nine Finns. We started as a group of students who didn't really know each other, assuming that we are going to spend our summer studying synthetic biology with strange collegues. We ended up getting a bunch of new friends and (in addition to studying synthetic biology) we just might have spent one of the best summers of our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our group is interdisciplinary and comes from University of Helsinki and Aalto University; the two big universities located in the capital of Finland, Helsinki. We have expertise in many different fields ranging from genetics to product development and from computer science to food technology.

            <small>Captain</small></h3>
            <h4 class="university-title">Aalto University<br>University of Helsinki</h4>
            <p>
                I’m a synthetic biology enthusiast with a mathematical background and crazy ideas. I’m definitely an optimist so often I need somebody to keep my feet on the ground. I’m very curious and one of the best entertainment is to find out how everything works. I also love to code but lately, I haven’t had too much time for that. In fall 2014 I started my Master’s studies in Biotechnology at ETH Zürich and I’m majoring Synthetic Biology.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2013 I heard about iGEM and I knew immediately that I want to participate it. I took an initiative to found the first-ever Finnish iGEM team and thus, I ended up being the team captain. This means I’m the jack-of-all-trades trying to peek my nose to everything but I’m not really getting things done. I’ve been writing tons of emails, funding applications and developed new ideas but pretty much all the credit of implementing them goes to the rest of our awesome team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used to play piano, frisbeegolf, do scouting and go cycling. Since I moved to Switzerland (this odd country with a weird set of languages not familiar to me) I’ve tried to enjoy cycling as much as possible because those other hobbies do not really work out here. After iGEM I’m going to look forward to try something new and get involved in new projects. And I already miss sauna and rye bread!

            <h4 class="university-title">Aalto University</h4>
            <p>
                A fourth-year Chemical Engineering student majoring in bio and food technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am the second half of our lab team and I have been in charge of the wet lab with Martina. I have spent most of my days in the lab working with Biobricks and our dear bacteria.
                I am also the Travel Manager of our team so I have been in charge of all the things related to Boston.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the beginning of the summer I knew barely anything about gene technology, let alone synthetic biology, so it has been amazing to learn a whole bunch of new things and actually getting to do stuff in the lab on our own.
            </p>
            <p>
                One hightlight of my summer was when we got our first sequencing results and we finally had concrete proof that we had actually managed to ligate pieces of DNA together. Before that we just had to have faith in ourselves and hope things were going the right way. Now I know why some people say that science is like a religion!
            </p>
            </p>
                Music, puppies, travelling, a good cup of tea and sleeping in on a Sunday morning are my favourite things in the world.

            <small>Designer</small></h3>
            <h4 class="university-title">University of Helsinki</h4>
            <p>
                I’m a fourth year student majoring in Molecular Biosciences and minoring in Computer Science. I’m also interested in art and design. In our iGEM team my main responsibility has been designing things; both the genetic switch and our own visual appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’d have the required skills to work in the laboratory, too, but I ended up spending most of the summer either researching, drawing or coding. I learned a lot about designing genetic mechanisms and also an enormous amount of css tricks. It was amazing to see that it was actually possible to do all the things that interest me for the same project, even though they seem so far apart at first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes I entirely lose the sense of time and place while focusing on something interesting. I might fixate on a drawing, a game, a problem, or even studying, and completely forget everything else for a while. This is often useful, but sometimes also troublesome.

            <p>
                My main responsibility was programming various software tools to help research and lab work, as well as developing our website and wiki. I also racked up a surprising amount of lab hours considering I had last worked in the lab 3 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also did a bunch of bioinformatics. I found myself playing around with Geneious a lot, making primers, analysing sequencing results and building things virtually before we assemble them in the lab.
            </p>
            <p>
                The coolest thing during the summer was making BioBrick Seeker and seeing what can be achieved by a group of students in a field that we barely knew anything about.

            <small>BioBrick Master</small></h3>
            <h4 class="university-title">Aalto University</h4>
            <p>
                I’m Bachelor of science (technology) in chemical engineering. This is my fourth year and I’m starting Master’s  studies majoring bio- and food technology, at Aalto University.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have spent the summer mostly in the wet lab and made loads of gel runs, ligations and transformations, that is, the cloning. My special skill is the Biobricks, as I had already had an introduction to them when making my Bachelor’s thesis last spring. So I knew the principles of the assembly techniques although I had never done any gene technology lab work before.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the work with my thesis I regretted I would never know if Biobricks are useful in reality. The stroke of luck came in the form of an announcement to build up the first-ever Finnish iGEM team. In theory, Biobricks sounded like a cool way of making genetic engineering easier but now I really got an opportunity to do some hands-on work with Biobricks!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my official hobbies I would include synchronized skating and scouting which both I have been into since I was a kid. In addition, I like knitting, spending time outside in the nature and geocaching. For sure I’m going to find some geocaches in Boston, too!

            <p>
                Although you can often find me lost in thought, I’m generally quite outgoing and spend most of my time discussing recent topics with my colleagues and sampling fine brews, such as coffees and ales.

            </p>
            <p>
                In this project I’ve been in charge of the communications. My main task has been stirring a bustle in the media; both traditional and social. My job has included updating Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube accounts and writing a blog on our website. I’ve also been contacting Finnish press and written few stories in relevant magazines.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests cover a wide area of different fields; from biochemistry and gene technology to communications and influencing. I have also given the team members tips in performance, since I have quite a lot performing experience. Likewise the other members, I have also been a little bit all over the place, sometimes working in laboratory and sometimes attending the Summer of Startups program. I also wrote, directed and produced our teaser video to Demo Day.

                The summer has been a fantastic experience! Learning about gene circuits and BioBricks has been very interesting, but also taking a sneak peek in communication on the field has been educational.

            </p>
            <p>
                Aalto University helped us in multiple ways. They offered us great mentors and a work environment where you could ask anything from the experienced lab people around you. They gave us space in the lab to work in, they supported us us financially, they ordered us reagents when we needed. Synthesizing our gene switch wasn't a problem either. It feels like we couldn't have done this, or at least this would have been a severely harder project, without Aalto.

The program made us view our project from business point of view and gave the opportunity to learn how to talk science to business people.
